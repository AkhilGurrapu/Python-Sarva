        <h3>Variables and Assignment in Python</h3>
        <p>In Python, variables are used to store data values. Unlike some other programming languages, Python has no command for declaring a variable. A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.</p>
        
        <h4>Key Points:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Variables don't need to be declared with any particular type</li>
            <li>Python uses = for assignment</li>
            <li>Variable names should be descriptive and follow naming conventions</li>
            <li>Python variables are case-sensitive</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Example:</h4>
        <pre>
        # Assigning values to variables
        x = 5
        y = "Hello, World!"

        # Print variables
        print(x)
        print(y)

        # Reassigning variables
        x = 10
        print(x)

        # Multiple assignment
        a, b, c = 1, 2, 3
        print(a, b, c)
        </pre>

        <p>Try creating and using variables in the practice area!</p>

    practice: `# Create a variable called 'name' and assign it your name
# Then print a greeting using this variable

# Your code here
